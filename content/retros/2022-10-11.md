## More Stuff

### Visual Studio Code has decent support for Bash!

I didn't know that if you write a "docstring" for a function within Bash,
VSCode will show it when you hover over it. I also didn't know that VSCode
supports "Go To Definition" for Bash functions.

All the more proof that Bash can make okay software if you are patient enough!

(I would have still preferred to use Golang for this.)
