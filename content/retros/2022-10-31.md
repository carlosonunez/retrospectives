- **Docker 102**: Write Chapter 0 and write first two chapters of Chapter 1.
- **KDP**: It can install and configure shared services.
- **KDP**: Clusters provisioned by KDP can access those shared services.

...or how my previously-working end-to-end tests decided to stop working the minute I really begin working on KDP again. It's annoying.

Besides that, it was difficult to get back into the groove of things. Lots of travel, and some other work took away the laser focus I had on shipping KDP.

On one hand, this is a good thing. I was working _a lot_ to get it to the point it's at now. I'm happy with where we are.

On the other hand, I'm unhappy that we're stuck here. I feel like we should have been further along but couldn't get there due to _basically_ people constraints.

This made getting stuck by my end-to-end tests frustrating. I was focused on adding this new feature that I'm hoping to demo but spent most of the day fighting my test suite. Everytime this happens, I want to give up test-driven development, but then quickly remember that if it weren't for this, we would just be testing even more unknowns in production.
